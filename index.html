        <h3>Web front-end performance monitoring</h3>

<p>This project aims to automate the monitoring or your website load time from an end-user point of view (with multiple synthetic tests). It uses PhantomJS to access webpages, and record the time it takes to download each individual requests using the HAR format. This analysis report is then saved to a database to later aggregate more informations about the load time for the page and the individual requests.</p>

<h3>Â Installing</h3>

<p>To download and install the project you can either install manually each components on your server/box, or use the provided <a href="https://github.com/leibowitz/perfmonitor/wiki/Getting-Started">chef recipes</a> to setup a VirtualBox (automated), VMWare (not tested) or AWS (require manual steps) machine with everything pre-installed.</p>

<h3>Requisites</h3>

<ul>
<li>MongoDB &gt;= 2.2</li>
<li>PHP &gt;= 5.3.2 (and extensions: mongo)</li>
<li>Python (and libs: pymongo, celery)</li>
<li>PhantomJS &gt;= 1.5</li>
<li>RabbitMQ</li>
<li>A Web server (apache, nginx)</li>
</ul><h3>Why create another tool for this?</h3>

<p>Many tools already exists online, as services, and even open source projects. But many of them are not giving enough informations about individual assets, are providing only the result of one individual page load, or are just giving the average load time for multiple requests. The main objective of this tool is to provide monitoring of your pages over time, by loading the same page multiple times, discarding the extreme values, and returning a stable significant value of the front-end performance of your page, in an automated way, ie continuous load time performance testing. </p>

<p>Also the customisation of existing tools is quite difficult, thus starting a project from scratch with a simple interface and code makes it very flexible to add functionalities.</p>

<p>Google Analytics and NewRelic are good at giving you Real User Measurement, that tells you how your website performs in the real world. This is not what this tool is intending to monitor. It is mainly to track the performance from one point of view and make sure that any optimisation or regular development (features) are not degrading the load time of your site. Regardless of if you are using caching or not, it will provide you a good idea of how slow your pages are.</p>
